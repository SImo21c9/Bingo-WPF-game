This is a fun side project called Bingo (yes, like the game bingo). To play this game you either need paper or to imagine numbers in your head and write it off when you see it. This game can be played with multiple people.  if you need further explaination on how the game works, here is a link to explain it ![link](https://www.britannica.com/topic/bingo-game-of-chance) 

Here is how the game works
- On the left side is the numbers that haven't been picked. At the start of the match there are 90 numbers (from 1 to 90).
-On the right side is the numbers that have been picked. After you click "tryk her" a random number between 1-90 will be transfered from "available numbers" to "Picked numbers". After its transfered to the right side, it will be removed from the left side (available number)
- As the game goes on the numbers will decrease randomly in an order. The latest generated number will be the last on the list. If you see the a number on the left appear that is also on you paper, you can write it off 
- It will go on like that until there is a winner
